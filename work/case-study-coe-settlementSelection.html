              </div>
              <p class="hero-copy">Before we can get started creating anything we need to firmly define what the goals for our User is, and then after that we will address business goals. The reason I try to target the User's needs before business is to make sure we focus on their needs and goals before our own, because without our users we do not have a product. </p>  
              
              <p class="hero-copy">The first thing our users want is to be able to see the world they will be joining, so the primary goal is to make sure we are giving them a map, but one of the constraints that I need to deal with is how much of a map can I give them. It is a fine balancing game where if I give them too little they will feel like they are being cheated, and if I reveal too much information it defeats the purpose of exploration that is a core feature of the game.</p> 

              <p class="hero-copy">I needed more information before making an informed decision. I gathered the game designers and went over which information would be too much for the players to know before playing the game. Once I had that information I was able to create a list of data requirements needed for the map. This allowed me to make a comprehensive list of assets needed which I handed off to our visual designer to create. </p>

              <p class="hero-copy">After I knew what the map was going to look like I then needed to create a list of user stories for all the interactions our users might make during Settlement Selection. This list also informs me on which parts of the website will need to be included in the launch of the product.</p>

                <h2 class="tagline">???</h2>
                <p class="hero-copy">The next thing I needed to do was to figure out where to get started. I began by creating a list of all components we currently have on our website, starting with our v2 site which was built with REACT. </p>
                <p class="hero-copy">Once I began moving over the components into the style guide, I began to come across several problems that would slow down the development. Many of our components were not built to be flexible enough to exist outside of our website, so I took on the task of updating our components to be more adaptable. This was mainly done by scoping the SCSS to only be used inside the components themselves.</p>

                  <p class="hero-copy">After doing my first pass on the style guide it allowed me to get some hands on testing with our development team using the tool.</p>
                  <p class="hero-copy">I created a list of feedback from my team including, likes, dislikes, and suggested improvements. With this feedback I was able to create some quality of life features to address issues such as speed to impliment, and some preview modes that allowed them to see the components at different resolutions.</p>

                    <p class="hero-copy">After creating the initial Style Guide we found that feature releases for marketing pages had increased dramatically. Single static pages that would take 2-3 days were now being released in under a day. We also had more consistancy with all our brand since everything was being driven from a single source of truth. I was also able to include documentation using Markdown on each component that also informed the developers how each component was meant to be used, for example: "No more than one CTA button can be used on a page, and cannot be used next to a Primary Button." and other guidelines to help answer any questions that might be brought up during development.</p>
