                    <p>
                        I was one of the first Employees hired by Unikrn and helped launch the initial MVP site. Our goal was to get that site up and running to test the viability of the market. Once this was done we decided we needed to optimize the site, focus on user acquisition, and retentions. For this project most of our focus was on the landing page and the sign up form.

                    <p>
                        We had a small 4 person team that located in Seattle and Berlin Germany. The German team lead development with one server side engineer, and one front end engineer. The Seattle team consisted of our Graphic Designer who handled asset creation and myself as Product Manager/ UX design.

      <p class="hero-copy">For <b>User Retention</b> I wanted to focus on our return users. This way I know that users are enjoying the site and coming back to either place more bets or watch more of games.</p>   
      <p class="hero-copy">To make sure I am not looking purely at one dimension for results I decided to use our number of <b>Daily Users</b> to validate both increasing our user base and returning users since this is a solid representation of both.</p>

                  The gaming industry (especially esports,) tends to be a male dominated industry. In our case only 4% of our audience was female so the majority of our efforts would be spent creating a look and feel that would appeal to the male audience. Looking at facebook and Google Analytics I was able to see that the majority of our audience was in the 24-28 age range, which is exactly where we would want it to be for a betting platform.

                        Many of the established betting sites such as Sportsbook.ag had very targeted signup funnels. One of the things that we didn't impliment in our initial MVP launch of Unikrn.com was a signup with Facebook option. This would allow us to get new users with the least amount of friction. This option wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, it does come with some constraints, such as you only get the email associated with the facebook account, in many cases these were throw away emails so adding a secondary email validation step after account creation was sometimes neccessary.

During this time I try to really focus on our target user and put myself in their shoes, what would they want, what would they expect the interface to do. I firmly believe the best way to improve your customers experience is through Empathy. You need to understand them before you can help them.</p>

                  <p class="hero-copy">One of the launch features was the idea of customized quadrants. A user could come to Unikrn.com and customize how the homepage is laid out. The main reason for this is we noticed that our users were betting on specific Games, for example, User Steve would only bet on League of Legends games but not CS:GO games. This led me to believe that the majority of users would only bet on the games they liked to play. So when a user would set the upper left quandrant on unikrn to show League of Legends games, it would only show League of Legends games until changed. This way a user can customize how their homepage is laid out. </p>

Using the metrics defined earlier along with creating personas from Google Analytics I was able to look at how users are using the site and from that find their pain points.</p>

                        <p> In a startup you have to be very creative with resources. You may not have access to large testing environments, eye tracking software, or the ability to do large user studies to gather information. For this project I used a combination of Optimizely for AB testing, Google Analytics to validate my findings, Peek usability testing to get live analysis of users on the site, and my personal favorite, <a href="http://www.hotjar.com" target="_blank">Hotjar</a> to view a users journy through the website.</p>
